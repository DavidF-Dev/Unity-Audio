# Audio Solution for Unity (In Development)
This asset provides an easy solution for **playing audio clips, sound effects and music** without needing to worry about managing Audio Sources. I've designed it to be simply plug-and-play with no setup required.

Features:
- Play an audio clip at any time and control playback without worrying about Audio Sources.
- Play a music track, automatically fading in and out between tracks.
- Create - and play - sound effect assets, assisting in setting up specific types of sounds (e.g. footsteps, gunshots, etc.)
- Play audio clips, music and sound effects easily from the Unity Resources folder.
- Helpful audio-related functions.

## Setup
Simply import the package into your project and you're good to go. No additional setup is required.
- Download directly from the [releases](https://github.com/DavidF-Dev/Unity-Audio/releases) tab & import in Unity (<i>Assets>Import Package</i>).
- Import via the Unity package manager (<i>Window>Package Manager</i>).
  - Git URL: ``https://github.com/DavidF-Dev/Unity-Audio.git``</br>

  - <i>Or</i> add the following line to <i>Packages/manifest.json</i>:</br>``"com.davidfdev.audio": "https://github.com/DavidF-Dev/Unity-Audio.git"``

## Usage
No setup is required. To access the scripts, include the ``DavidFDev.Audio`` namespace at the top of your file. The core functionality of the asset is contained in the ``Audio`` static class, which exposes methods for playing audio clips, sound effects & music.
- ``Play(AudioClip, Position [optional], AudioMixerGroup [optional])``: play the provided audio clip.
- ``Play(Path, Position [optional], AudioMixerGroup[optional])``: play an audio clip loaded from the Resources folder.
- ``PlaySfx(SoundEffect, Position [optional])``: play the provided sound effect.
- ``PlaySfx(Path, Position [optional])``: play a sound effect loaded from the Resources folder.
- ``PlayMusic(AudioClip, FadeIn, FadeOut)``: play the provided music track.
- ``PlayMusic(Path, FadeIn, FadeOut)``: play a music track loaded from the Resources folder.

</br>Calling ``Play()`` or ``PlaySfx()`` will return an instance of Playback which allows control of the Audio Source indirectly.
E.g.
```cs
Playback playback = Audio.PlaySfx(sfx);
playback.Pause();
playback.Volume = 0.4f;
playback.Loop = true;
```

</br>Sound effects are scriptable objects that can be added to your Assets. They are used for setting up specific types of sounds. An instance can be played by calling the ``Play()`` method or by passing it in to ``Audio.PlaySfx()``.

### Examples
```cs
Audio.Play("Audio/death_scream", enemy.position);
```
This call will load the `death_scream` Audio Clip from the Resources folder and play it at the enemy's position.
</br></br>
```cs
Audio.PlayMusic(music, fadeIn: 1f, fadeOut: 0.75f);
Debug.Log($"Current music track: {Audio.CurrentMusic.name}");
```
Playing a music track will crossfade the new track with the old track, if one was already playing. The currently playing music track can be queried through ``Audio.CurrentMusic``.
</br></br>
```cs
Playback playback = Audio.Play(clip, position: new Vector3(0f, 1f, 0f), output: output);
playback.ForceFinish();
```
An Audio Mixer Group can be provided to control where the audio signal is routed. Also, a sound can be stopped prematurely by calling ``ForceFinish()`` on the Playback instance. Note that - unlike with Audio Sources - Playback instances cannot be replayed once the audio has finished playing.
